# Command My Startup: Deployment Fixes Snapshot

**Date: April 1, 2025**

This document captures the key fixes implemented to resolve deployment issues with the Command My Startup frontend on Vercel.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. React and Dependency Compatibility

**Issue:** The frontend was using React v19.1.0 and various other dependencies that had compatibility issues with Vercel's build system.

**Solution:**
- Downgraded React to v18.2.0 for better compatibility
- Downgraded Next.js from 15.2.4 to 14.1.0
- Pinned critical dependencies to exact versions:
  - react: 18.2.0
  - react-dom: 18.2.0
  - @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs: 0.8.7
  - tailwindcss: 3.3.6
  - @tailwindcss/typography: 0.5.10
- Added critters for CSS optimization
- Added package resolutions to ensure consistent dependency versions

**Key files modified:**
- `frontend/package.json` - Updated dependencies and engine requirements
- `frontend/vercel.json` - Added Node version configuration

### 2. Next.js Configuration Issues

**Issue:** The Next.js configuration had several settings incompatible with Vercel's build system.

**Solution:**
- Updated experimental configuration in next.config.js
- Changed `serverComponentsExternalPackages` to `serverExternalPackages`
- Removed `swcMinify: true` which caused build failures
- Disabled CSS optimization to prevent critters dependency issues
- Added proper image optimization settings

**Key files modified:**
- `frontend/next.config.js` - Updated configuration
- `frontend/vercel.json` - Added proper resource settings

### 3. CSS and Font Handling Issues

**Issue:** The application was using next/font/google which has compatibility issues with Vercel deployment.

**Solution:**
- Switched to standard web font imports via link tags
- Fixed layout.tsx to avoid using next/font
- Modified tailwind.config.js to use Inter font directly
- Created a CSS fix script that handles font module issues
- Simplified globals.css to include only necessary styles

**Key files modified:**
- `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx` - Removed next/font usage
- `frontend/src/app/globals.css` - Simplified CSS
- `frontend/tailwind.config.js` - Updated font configuration
- `frontend/fix-vercel-css.js` - Script for CSS compatibility fixes

### 4. API Route Configuration

**Issue:** API routes were failing with errors related to cookies and dynamic rendering.

**Solution:**
- Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to all API routes
- Updated middleware.ts to work correctly with auth-helpers
- Fixed the route handler for dynamic segments

**Key files modified:**
- All files in `frontend/src/api/**/route.ts`
- All files in `frontend/src/app/api/**/route.ts`
- `frontend/fix-routes.sh` - Script to add dynamic exports to route files

### 5. Build Process Optimization

**Issue:** Build process was failing due to resource limitations and configuration issues.

**Solution:**
- Created optimized vercel-build.sh script
- Added NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=3072" to increase memory
- Used clean-install instead of regular install for dependencies
- Created clean-deploy.sh script for simplified deployment

**Key files modified:**
- `frontend/vercel-build.sh` - Enhanced build script
- `frontend/deploy-to-vercel.sh` - Improved deployment script
- `frontend/clear-cache.sh` - Updated cleanup script

## Implementation Plan

The fixes were implemented in a systematic approach:

1. **Environment Cleanup**
   - Complete removal of build artifacts and node_modules
   - Cache clearing and fresh dependency installation

2. **Dependency Updates**
   - Pinned exact versions for critical packages
   - Added resolutions and overrides for consistency

3. **Configuration Updates**
   - Modified Next.js configuration for compatibility
   - Updated Vercel configuration with proper resource settings

4. **Layout and CSS Fixes**
   - Simplified layout.tsx to avoid next/font
   - Updated globals.css with proper variables
   - Added font imports via standard link tags

5. **Build Process Improvements**
   - Enhanced build scripts with better error handling
   - Added CSS and route fix scripts

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy the fixed application:

1. **Prepare the environment:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ./clear-cache.sh
   ```

2. **Apply all fixes:**
   ```bash
   ./deploy-to-vercel.sh
   ```

3. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

## Verification Steps

After deployment, verify the following:

1. Check that the application loads correctly
2. Verify authentication flow works
3. Test API endpoints functionality
4. Confirm styling and layouts render properly
5. Validate dynamic routes and middleware
