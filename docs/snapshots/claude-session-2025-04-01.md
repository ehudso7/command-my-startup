# Claude Session - April 1, 2025: Vercel Deployment Fixes

## Session Summary

This session focused on fixing Vercel deployment issues for the Command My Startup frontend. The frontend was failing to build on Vercel despite building successfully in local development. Several critical issues were identified and fixed, resulting in a successful production deployment.

## Key Issues Fixed

1. **React and Dependency Compatibility**
   - Downgraded React from v19.1.0 to v18.2.0
   - Added missing @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs v0.8.7
   - Updated TailwindCSS and related dependencies
   - Adjusted Node.js and npm engine requirements

2. **Route Handler Dynamic Rendering**
   - Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to all API routes
   - Created a script to automate adding dynamic exports to routes
   - Fixed middleware's Supabase client creation pattern

3. **Server Component Serialization**
   - Added serverComponentsExternalPackages in next.config.js
   - Fixed empty chat/id page with proper redirect
   - Disabled swcMinify to prevent build issues

4. **Build Configuration**
   - Updated vercel.json with proper build settings
   - Created comprehensive clear-cache.sh script
   - Improved error handling in middleware

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Optimization**
