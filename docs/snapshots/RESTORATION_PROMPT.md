# Command My Startup - Restoration Prompt

The following prompt can be used to restore the state of the project and continue from where we left off:

---

I've been working on the "Command My Startup" app, specifically the frontend part. I previously worked with Claude to fix a number of issues with the frontend codebase, and now I need to continue that work or restore my understanding of where we left off.

Here's what we previously fixed:

1. **ESLint Configuration**: 
   - Updated `.eslintrc.js` to include necessary globals for browser APIs, DOM elements, and React
   - Created proper `eslint.config.js` with configurations for Next.js, React, TypeScript
   - Added ignore patterns for build artifacts and test files

2. **TypeScript Compatibility**:
   - Updated Stripe API versions from "2022-11-15" to "2025-02-24.acacia" across all files
   - Fixed Supabase authentication hooks and cookies handling
   - Created proper type definitions for tests and browser APIs
   - Modified tsconfig.json to temporarily disable strict mode

3. **Testing Setup**:
   - Fixed Button component to include role="status" for loading spinner
   - Added Next.js navigation mocks for tests
   - Fixed AuthContext tests to work with App Router
   - Updated Cypress configuration with proper baseUrl

4. **Build Process**:
   - Successfully built the application
   - All tests are now passing
   - Application loads and runs correctly

The main files we worked on were:
- `.eslintrc.js`, `eslint.config.js`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `src/types/global.d.ts` (created)
- `src/contexts/__mocks__/next_navigation.tsx` (created for test mocking)
- `src/lib/stripe.ts`, `src/lib/stripe/stripe-client.ts`
- `src/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`, `src/api/subscriptions/*`
- `src/components/ui/Button.tsx`
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`, `src/contexts/UploadContext.tsx`
- `src/lib/ai/client.ts`
- `cypress.config.ts`, `cypress/support/commands.ts`

Going forward, I want to:
1. [Insert your next goals here, such as: add a new feature, improve testing, deploy the application]
2. Continue to improve type safety and re-enable strict mode
3. Deploy the application

Please help me continue from where we left off, providing guidance on these next steps.

This prompt will help you restore the context of what we've done and effectively continue your work with Claude or another assistant in the future.
