# Testing Strategy for Command My Startup

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for Command My Startup (CMS), ensuring the application is reliable, performant, and bug-free before deployment to production.

## 2. Testing Levels

### 2.1 Unit Testing

- **Purpose**: Test individual components and functions in isolation
- **Tools**: Jest, React Testing Library for frontend; Pytest for backend
- **Coverage Target**: 80% code coverage for critical functionality
- **Responsibility**: Developers

### 2.2 Integration Testing

- **Purpose**: Test interactions between components and services
- **Tools**: Jest, React Testing Library, Pytest
- **Focus Areas**: API integrations, database interactions, authentication flow
- **Responsibility**: Developers

### 2.3 End-to-End Testing

- **Purpose**: Test complete user flows from start to finish
- **Tools**: Cypress
- **Scenarios**: User registration, login, command execution, chat, subscription
- **Responsibility**: QA team and developers

### 2.4 Performance Testing

- **Purpose**: Evaluate system performance under load
- **Tools**: JMeter, Lighthouse
- **Metrics**: Response time, throughput, resource utilization
- **Responsibility**: DevOps team

### 2.5 Security Testing

- **Purpose**: Identify vulnerabilities and security risks
- **Tools**: OWASP ZAP, npm audit, Snyk
- **Focus Areas**: Authentication, authorization, data protection
- **Responsibility**: Security team

## 3. Testing Environments

### 3.1 Development Environment

- Local development machines
- Purpose: Unit and component testing during development

### 3.2 Staging Environment

- Mirrors production setup
- Purpose: Integration and E2E testing before deployment

### 3.3 Production Environment

- Live environment
- Purpose: Smoke tests and monitoring

## 4. Test Automation

### 4.1 CI/CD Integration

- Automated tests run on GitHub Actions
- Unit and integration tests run on every pull request
- E2E tests run before deployment to staging

### 4.2 Test Reporting

- Test results published to dashboard
- Code coverage reports generated and tracked

## 5. Bug Tracking and Resolution

- All bugs tracked in GitHub Issues
- Severity levels:
  - Critical: Must be fixed immediately
  - High: Must be fixed before next release
  - Medium: Should be fixed in upcoming releases
  - Low: Fix when time permits

## 6. Test Data Management

- Test data seeded in development and staging environments
- Sanitized production data used for testing where appropriate
- Synthetic data generated for edge cases

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

- All unit and integration tests must pass
- Code coverage must meet targets
- No critical or high-severity bugs
- Performance benchmarks must be met

## 8. Testing Schedule

- Unit tests: Continuously during development
- Integration tests: Daily
- E2E tests: Before each staging deployment
- Performance tests: Weekly
- Security tests: Monthly

## 9. Responsibilities

- Developers: Write and maintain unit and integration tests
- QA Team: Design and execute E2E test scenarios
- DevOps: Set up test automation and CI/CD integration
- Product Owner: Define acceptance criteria

## 10. Tools and Resources

- Jest + React Testing Library: Frontend testing
- Pytest: Backend testing
- Cypress: E2E testing
- GitHub Actions: CI/CD automation
- JMeter: Performance testing
- OWASP ZAP: Security testing
